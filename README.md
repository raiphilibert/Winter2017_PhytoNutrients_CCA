# Winter2017_PhytoNutrients_CCA

This GitHub repository is related to the submitted manuscript of Viljoen et al. titled “Winter dynamics of phytoplankton and micronutrients in the Southern Ocean” (Preprint). This repository includes the R scripts to conduct the CCA analyses to elucidate relationships between macro and micronutrients and the phytoplankton community structure.

The compilation of original data used for the upper 150m (i.e. matched phytoplankton data) and compilation of trace metal data used for the upper 250m can be found in a Zenodo repository at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6615070 (Viljoen et al., 2025).

The CCA analyses are run for various subsets of data. A parent R markdown script is used to set up all the analyses and the child R markdown script (child.Rmd) contains the steps for each analysis.
